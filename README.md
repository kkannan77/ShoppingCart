# Business rules

We are re-designing their product system to give more flexibility to clients on which products to purchase. Following is a table of products we offer:

---------------------------------------------- 
PRODUCT ID	|  PRODUCT NAME	      |    PRICE   |
----------------------------------------------
wf	        | Workflow	          |    $199.99

docgen	    | Document Generation	|    $9.99

form	      | Form	              |    $99.99

----------------------------------------------
 
Also, we currently have these promotion codes:

---------------------------------------------
PROMO         CODE	            DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------

RRD4D32	      10%               discount for orders above $1000 (pre-discount)

44F4T11	      15%               discount for orders above $1500 (pre-discount)

FF9543D1	                      Reduces the docgen price to $8.99 a unit when at least 10 documents are purchased

YYGWKJD	                        Reduces the form price to $89.99 a unit when at least 1 wf is purchased


For simplicity sake, only one promotion code can be applied at a time.
